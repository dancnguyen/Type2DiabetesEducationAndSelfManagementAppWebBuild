# Type 2 Diabetes Education And Self Management App Web Build

https://dancnguyen.github.io/Type2DiabetesEducationAndSelfManagementAppWebBuild/

This is the web build for my Type 2 Diabetes Education and Self Management App.

This application was created using Flutter for the Front-End and Firebase for the Back-End. Flutter allows building for cross platform. This specific repository is meant to host the web build of the application.

This application allows for a patient user login and a provider user login. Credentials for both are found in the Google Survey provided with distribution of this application.
